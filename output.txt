Thanks!', 'I highly recommend Cowboy Concrete for their excellent work and service. I replaced my concrete garage driveway pad and long walkway to alley. The crew was very professional and Armando (the crew boss) is a gem. He explained everything to be done and patiently and nicely answered my questions about the upcoming work. The job was a bit pricey for me but I believe you get what you pay for and Cowboy Concrete guarantees their work. All in all I am very very pleased.

If you’re looking for a matching Pair of Nightstands, I have 2 really nice like-new modern nightstands. \n\nNo stains, no smells (smoke free household). They’ve even been dusted and sanitized with Clorox wipes all around the outside (and in).\n\nThey are not super high style nightstands, so would match great with a low profile bed, maybe even a regular height bed. \n\nBlack metal base, medium (cool) colored wood top. (sorry, I don’t know the name of wood finishes - see pictures) and I believe it’s solid wood too with mdf on the on the base (below drawer, between the top part and the metal base).\n\n$80 for BOTH but negotiable.\n\nMessage me if interested and I can send measurements. 😉 University and Skillman.\nSee more…']
